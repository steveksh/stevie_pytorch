# PyTorch

This Repository is a personal space where I store my ML Exercises and models I created using the pytorch ml framework. 

I have always used keras and scikit-learn, but I have slowly realized they are more catered towards developers who want a plug-and-play framework. From my own work experience working as a data scientist at a data / marketing agency, however, these ML frameworks are usually robust enough to handle client's requests.

Regardless, it prompted me the idea of learning PyTorch, so here I am!
